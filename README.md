# Sprint 2, Task 2, MySql Queries

## Exercise Description:

This project includes two relational databases: Tienda and Universidad, each with its own schema and a comprehensive set of SQL queries. The main objective is to practice and demonstrate SQL skills by solving a variety of queries involving selection, filtering, sorting, grouping, subqueries, and table joins. The queries simulate real-world scenarios such as managing products and manufacturers, as well as handling academic data related to students, professors, courses, and degree programs.
The project also features a tiered certification system based on the number of correctly completed queries, with a special focus on those related to the Universidad database.

### ***Level1:***
Achieved by completing at least 37 correct queries, with 20 or more based on the Universidad schema.

### ***Level2:***
Achieved by completing between 37 and 56 correct queries, with at least 20 from the Universidad schema

### ***Level3:***
Achieved by completing more than 56 correct queries, including at least 20 from the Universidad schema.
